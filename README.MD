#### MR ROGER'S NEIGHBORHOOD 6/12/2020

#### By Payne Fulcher 

## Description  

Mr Roger's Neighborhood creates a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with the following exceptions:

Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Won't you be my neighbor?"

These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception should apply unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third. So, for example, in your finished program,

The number 13 is replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
The number 21 is replaced with "Boop".
The number 32 is be replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
